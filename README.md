Teaching an old dog new tricks
I have ben playing around with Swift on the iPad, which at 42 at first felt a bit daft but as I have progressed a tiny bit, it becomes quite addictive.
I am a HiFi nutter, couldn't live without music in my life, this is leading me towards the Raspberry Pi to enable multiroom audio via RAAT, probably a pi3 with digi+ optical out to the kitchen system and another for the bedroom to make use of a roon Labs sub running on a Mac Mini via usb to main sytem. 
These are just put together pieces with software already written and available to download, pretty simple stuff, which got me thinking, ssomeone had to do all the hard work of writing, testing, debugging etc. for me to just come along and plonk two boards together, download software, and achieve my objective.
I have some time on my hands and find the concept of programming interesting, challenging, but also amazing, with IoT exploding it seems a great time to learn how to make things communicate and maybe even put a little something back into the community in time.
