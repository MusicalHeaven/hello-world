Teaching an old dog new tricks.


I have ben playing around with Swift-Playgrounds on the iPad, which at 42 at first felt a bit daft, but as I have progressed a tiny bit, it becomes quite addictive.


I am a HiFi nutter, couldn't live without music in my life, this is leading me towards using the Raspberry Pi to enable multiroom audio via RAAT, probably a pi 3 with digi+ from HiFiBerry which enables optical out to the kitchen system and another for the bedroom to make full use of a roon-Labs subscription running on a Mac Mini via usb to the main sytem. 


These are just put together pieces with software already written and available to download, pretty simple stuff, which got me thinking, someone had to do all the hard work of writing, testing, debugging etc. for me to just come along and plonk two boards together, download software, and achieve my objective.


I have some time on my hands and find the concept of programming interesting, challenging, but also amazing, with the IoT exploding, it seems a great time to learn how to make things communicate with each over and maybe even put something back into the community in time.

Maybe in a decade or two!
